# Security Labs
This repo contains various labs that can be used to do hands-on learning for a variety of cybsersecurity-related things. Note that these may not be comprehensive, as this is also a learning experience for me in designing lab environments and automated provisioning. 

The labs that are in this repo are ones that I created for my own learning. As these took me a while to actually setup and configure, I figured I would try to make it easy for the next person and decided to upload the playbooks and scripts here.
